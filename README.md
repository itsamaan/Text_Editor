# Text-Editor
Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to create a real-world GUI application that will be
able to edit the text in different formats and layouts which will be different
from our old traditional text editor. This application will enable the user to
type text files and create important notes which will be flexible to use with
different kinds of tools and easy to use interface. It also comes with different
background themes and different font colors which let a user come out of a
traditional text editor.
Description:
A text editor is a computer program that lets a user enter, change, store, and usually
print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and its input and
output devices, arranged to have meaning to users or other programs). Typically, a
text editor provides an "empty" display screen (or "scrollable page") with a fixedline length and visible line numbers. A user can then fill the lines in with text, line
by line. A special command line lets the user move to a new page, scroll forward or
backward, make global changes in the document, save the document, and perform
other actions. After saving a document, the user can then print it or display it.
Before printing or displaying it, a user may be able to format it for some specific
output device or class of output device. This text editor can also be used to enter
program language source statements or to create documents such as technical
manuals. This text editor has the following features:
• It comes with a feature of selecting any font color.
• It also enables a user to insert the time and date into the editor.
• It also shows the total character and word counts in the status bar at the bottom
of the editor.
• It also comes with a feature of text alignment.
• As usual editor common features like underlining text, bold text, italic style,
etc.
• It also has a feature of saving the text file and opening any existing text files.
Conclusion
This is a text editor tool which is use to edit the text and is different
from normal note pad as it has different theme to give some cool effects
to our text.
It will also enable the user to use different font colors along with the
features of text editor which gives the user a whole new experience as
compared to the old traditional text editor.
